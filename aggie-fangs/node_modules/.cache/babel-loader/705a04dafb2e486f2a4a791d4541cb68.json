And the first thing that \r\n                    an employer can do to work toward that goal is by vetting the personalities of their \r\n                    employees through a personality interview. Often, this only consists of one or two questions \r\n                    or just an observation of how you conduct yourself throughout the interview. But how you do in \r\n                    this can mean the difference between being hired or not.\r\n                </body>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"guide-section\">\r\n                <h2>What Is My Interviewer Looking For?</h2>\r\n                <body>\r\n                    Many companies emphasize different things in their employees, so they may ask differing questions \r\n                    based on what they value. To get a good idea of what a company is looking for, try to find their \r\n                    values statement online. Here are some things that every company values in their employees to some \r\n                    extent:\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>A strong work ethic</li>\r\n                        <li>Teamwork and communication skills</li>\r\n                        <li>Ability to handle criticism</li>\r\n                        <li>Time management</li>\r\n                        <li>General problem solving skills</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </body>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"guide-section\">\r\n                <h2>What Is My Interviewer Trying To Avoid?</h2>\r\n                <body>\r\n                    Interviewers look for bad personality traits just as much as they do good personality \r\n                    traits. Here are some of the red flags that they may be watching for:\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li><i>Lack of professionalism.</i> Even in a job with little customer interaction, unprofessional people can be difficult to work with.</li>\r\n                        <li><i>Overly thought-out and prepared answers.</i> Canned answers can seem ingenuine and might tell a recruiter that the candidate is putting on a fake self.</li>\r\n                        <li><i>Excessive negativity about past jobs or experiences.</i> If you had a poor outlook on your past job, there is no way of knowing that you won't have the same attitude toward your next job.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </body>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"guide-section\">\r\n                <h2>How Do I Prepare For a Personality Interview?</h2>\r\n                <body>\r\n                    The best thing you can do to be prepared is to reflect on example personality interview questions \r\n                    and think about relevant past experiences that you can bring up.
