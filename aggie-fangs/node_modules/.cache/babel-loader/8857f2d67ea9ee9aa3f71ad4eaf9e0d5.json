If you don't have a personal github, make one and start adding projects \r\n                    you've done in the past. For each project, briefly describe the following:\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li><i>What was the main point of the project?</i> Focus on the most important point of the project and leave out minor details.</li>\r\n                        <li><i>What was your part in the project if you were in a group?</i> Talk about how you contributed to the team. If you had a leadership role, make sure to make that obvious in this description.</li>\r\n                        <li><i>What technical skills did you develop in this project?</i> i.e. data structures, algorithms, web-building, front-end/back-end, etc.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </body>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"guide-section\">\r\n                <h2>What Not To Put On Your Resume</h2>\r\n                <body>\r\n                    Remember, a recruiter could spend as little as 7 seconds or less looking at your resume.\r\n                    To optimize the time they spend, try to get rid of any of the following things on your resume:\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li><i>Big graphics and distracting style.</i> Anything unimportant that draws the recruiter's eye is a serious waste of time.</li>\r\n                        <li><i>Long, wordy paragraphs.</i> Do your best in each description to be as brief as possible. The longer a paragraph is, the less likely a recruiter is to read it.</li>\r\n                        <li><i>Information irrelevant to the job you're applying to.</i> 9 times out of 10, the recruiter will not care about your lifeguarding job in high school or the cosplay club in college. Only talk about your technical experience, leadership experience, and other relevant soft skills.</li>\r\n                        <li><i>Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.</i> Not proofreading your resume for spelling and grammatical errors comes across as very unprofessional.</li>\r\n                        <li><i>Inaccuracies about your education and experience.</i> Lying about what you do and don't know can only end poorly for you. Sooner or later, your employer will find out if you are not as qualified as you say you are.</li>\r\n                        <li><i>Solid walls of text.</i> Putting your resume in an organized list format will make it both more interesting to read and easier to scan.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </body>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"guide-section\">\r\n                <h2>Further Reference</h2>\r\n                <body>\r\n                    You can find more resources at the following pages:\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-a-killer-software-engineering-resume-b11c91ef699d/\">How To Write A Killer Resume</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/6-tips-for-a-software-engineer-resume-that-gets-you-hired\"> 6 Tips For A Resume That Will Get You Hired</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"https://novoresume.com/career-blog/software-engineer-resume\">Novoresume: Examples and Resume Builder</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/tips-for-building-a-stellar-tech-resume/\">6 Tips For Building A Stellar Tech Resume</a></li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </body>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Guide1"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
